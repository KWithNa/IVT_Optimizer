## üìå Overview 
**IVT Optimizer** is an interactive platform for personalized intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) treatment selection based on individual patient characteristics and clinical settings for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

## üî¨ Evidence Base  
The platform integrates results from a **network meta-analysis (NMA)** and **multidimensional benchmarking study** from published phase 3 randomized controlled trials, evaluating treatments across **four key domains**:
1. **Safety** ‚Äì Serious adverse events, intracranial hemorrhage, other endpoints, and numbers of serious adverse events classified into the eight major systems
2. **Efficacy** ‚Äì Efficacy outcomes evaluated by modified Rankin Scale, National Institute of Health stroke scale, and Barthel index
3. **Convenience** ‚Äì Administration complexity, storage requirements
4. **Affordability** ‚Äì Treatment cost

In default modeÔºå **four key domains** are quantified and weighted to compute an overall score:
| Domain | Weight (default) | Method |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Safety | 5 | P-scores from network meta-analysis |
| Efficacy | 5 | P-scores from network meta-analysis |
| Convenience | 0.5 | 3-tier scoring (storage 30 % + administration 70 %) |
| Affordability | 0.5 | Cost difference vs. highest-cost treatment (USD, 60 kg patient) |

Users can **dynamically adjust domain weights**, select therapeutic windows (‚â§4.5 h vs >4.5 h), and customize local cost/convenience parameters to obtain **personalized treatment rankings** in real time.

## üöÄ How to Use  
1. **Access**  
- Web: [https://kwithna.shinyapps.io/IVT_Optimizer/](https://kwithna.shinyapps.io/IVT_Optimizer/)  

2. **Set Weights**  
- Drag sliders in the **Weight Adjustment** panel to reflect patient priorities.

3. **Select Therapeutic Window**  
- **ALL**: No restriction
- **IN**: ‚â§ 4.5 h
- **OUT**: > 4.5 h  

5. **Customize Advanced Parameters**  
- **Storage Convenience**: Modify temperature, light, and shelf-life grading.  
- **Drug Costs**: Enter local prices (USD) or post-reimbursement values.

6. **Review Results**  
- Treatments are ranked by **overall score**; click column headers to sort them by individual domains.

**Inspiration** 
- The *dynbenchmark* project ([https://github.com/dynverse/dynbenchmark](https://github.com/dynverse/dynbenchmark)) by Saelens et al. provided critical methodological insights for our multidimensional benchmarking. Their open-source framework for comparing single-cell trajectory inference methods served as a foundational blueprint for this work.
